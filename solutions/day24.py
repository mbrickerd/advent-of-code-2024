class Solution(SolutionBase):
    """Solution for Advent of Code 2024 - Day 24: Crossed Wires.

    This class solves a puzzle about analyzing digital circuits and identifying wire connections.
    Part 1 executes a digital circuit to determine the output value, while Part 2 analyzes the
    circuit structure to identify wires that need to be swapped to fix an incorrectly wired adder.

    Input format:
        - Initial wire values section: lines with format "wireId: value" (0 or 1)
        - Blank line separator
        - Gate connections section: lines with format "input1 OPERATION input2 -> output"
        - Operations include AND, OR, and XOR
        - Wire IDs starting with 'x' and 'y' are inputs, those starting with 'z' are outputs

    This class simulates the circuit execution and analyzes its structure to identify
    incorrectly wired components in a full adder implementation.
