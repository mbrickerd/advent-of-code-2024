    This class solves a puzzle about analyzing lock and key combinations to determine
    valid pairings. Each lock and key is represented as a pattern of symbols, and
    the solution counts how many lock-key pairs will successfully open based on their
    combined patterns.

    Input format:
        - Multiple blocks separated by blank lines
        - Each block represents either a lock or a key pattern
        - Locks have 5 '#' symbols in their first row
        - Keys have a different number of '#' symbols in their first row
        - Each pattern consists of '#' and other symbols arranged in a grid

    The challenge involves analyzing the height profiles of locks and keys
    to determine which combinations will successfully open.

        """Count the number of valid lock-key pairs.

        Parses the input to extract lock and key patterns, computes their height
        profiles, and then determines how many combinations satisfy the opening
        criteria (combined height â‰¤ 5 for each column).

        The algorithm works by:
        1. Separating the input into individual lock and key patterns
        2. Converting each pattern into a height profile (count of '#' symbols per column)
        3. Testing each lock-key combination to see if their combined profiles meet the criteria

            data: List of strings containing lock and key patterns separated by blank lines

        Returns
        -------
            Integer count of valid lock-key combinations that will successfully open
